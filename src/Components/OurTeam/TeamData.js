        title: "Founder, CEO",
        about:"Our CEO, Diksha likes everything organized. Her room, her work, and her about section. Two years ago, she founded this creative agency to provide small businesses and corporations with delightful marketing services. Now? She helps businesses grow their audience and brand recognition through online modes. Along with prioritizing personal development she also focuses on developing others that makes her an effective leader. When she's not working, It's either caffeine or another set at the gym."

        title: "Director",
        about:"Our Director, Vishesh is a self-learner, and in the 6 years of his working life, he found that nothing satisfies him more than solving problems, and contributing to the growth of businesses. He loves the challenge of being told ‘no’ and turning it into a ‘yes’. That’s when he thought of opening his own agency along with Diksha. He thought it would be the perfect blend between his passions, creativity, problem-solving, technology, and design skills. When he’s not at work, he loves working out, shopping, playing games, and getting in front of the camera. Yes, he models too. "

        title: "Creative Head",
        about:"It’s tough to write about our creative head, more so because for him everything is about the visuals. Vishal has been working for 3 years and does graphic designing, illustration, UI design, and video editing.  You could describe Vishal as a gym freak, a font aficionado, and an eternal seeker of inspiration for his designs. Vishal believes in collaboration while not forgetting about his own journey."

        title: "Brand Strategist",
        about:"Our very lovely brand strategist has been working for 3 years now and is a people person (at least one of us is, haha). Having made the transition from HR, sales, and customer service, she now enjoys writing great copy and strategizing for brands. For her, every word is worth 1,000 memes. She loves talking to new people and discussing life, art, and anime. Yes, she is obsessed with anime. There’s always one of them in every group. She’s creative, loves experimenting with work, and also her hair color. Beware, she also knows how to box. ;) "

        title: "Web Developer",
        about:"Pankaj is a Full Stack Developer with proficiency in many languages. He is extremely focussed, of course, more so because he has the added stress of making the code compile and run properly. Even though he has just started out, his willingness to learn and take things head-on is what leaves us astonished. He has a 100% commitment to making all our sites the best they can possibly be, no matter what it takes to get there. When he’s not annoyed because of a code that doesn’t run smoothly, he’s either sketching, playing video games, or breaking a leg at dancing. "

        title: "Junior Graphic Designer",
        about:"Discipline falls ahead for Bhavesh always. A fresher, he has experience with Illustration, Figma, and Photoshop. You could call Bhavesh a hard worker with an unhealthy obsession for sleep and a love for tinkering with design that leaves us shocked. He’s also a keep-fit enthusiast who loves running, playing football, and Kabbadi. Bhavesh loves spending quality time with his loved ones, and also with us. At least, we like to think so. "
